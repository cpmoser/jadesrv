JadeSrv is a simple Jade Template Server built on Node.js.  Its purpose is to unify server and client template rendering by:

1. Mimicking the Node.js fs on the client side, using DOM storage when available,
2. Adding an "include" option to Jade templates,
3. Rendering Jade templates via POSTing JSON so that any language (e.g. PHP) can use JadeSrv to render templates.
