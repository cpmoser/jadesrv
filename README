JadeSrv is a simple Jade Template Server built on Node.js.  Its purpose is to unify server and client template rendering by:

1. Mimicking the Node.js fs on the client side, using DOM storage when available,
2. Adding an "include" option to Jade templates,
3. Rendering Jade templates via POSTing JSON so that any language (e.g. PHP) can use JadeSrv to render templates.

We'll need to:

1. Modify Jade to allow an "include" option,
2. Create a client side filesystem object that can mimick the fs object used in Node.js,
3. Modify Jade to use a generic fs object, allowing a client to pass its own as if it were running in Node.js,
4. Sync the client fs with the server

Todos:

1. Write a simple http server in Node.js that will do the following:
	a. Read a POST request that will render a template at the given URL correlating to a directory of templates, using POSTed JSON as the "locals" variable for Jade,
	b. Read a GET request that will return an unparsed Jade template.
2. Write a simple PHP class that will POST to the JadeSrv to get a rendered template.
3. Modify Jade to use includes
	a. We may have to pass an fs object to Jade.  This will become more important in doing the client side part.
4. Create a clientfs object that will act as a Node fs object in our modifications to Jade.
